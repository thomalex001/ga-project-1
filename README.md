DAY ONE:

HTML 
Created most HTML structure based one wireframe.

CSS:
styled the grid and used flexbox to move <aside> to the right.
Created Play Game and Restart buttons. Linked PlayGame button to JS. Play Game button functioning.

JS:
Created Grid 10*10
Added player and invaders on grid

Got stuck with invaders moving pattern, for some reason they would bounce on each side only for two lines.
Used "!goingRight" with a bang operator instead of "goingLeft", also increased grid to 20*20 as I was getting an error with 10*10.



DAY TWO :

Shooting:
if e.keycode=32
