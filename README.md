                                    INITIAL APPROACH
                                    ****************

Use Excalidraw for wireframe.

HTML:

1. Create basic HTML structure to have an MVP to work on

JS:
1. Link JS file to HTML
2. create a grid 20*20 inside game-container
3. add player on grid and set rules 
  limitations
4. Create aliens array and set limitations
5. Link a start/reset button
6. Add shooting functions on both sides
7. Add lives function
8. Add score function
9. Add Results function

CSS: 
1. Background images and styling will be as a Mario Gameplay
2. Ennemy will be Mario's longtime rival : Wario
2. Bullets thrown by Mario will be ball of fire
3. Bullets thrown by Wario will be Spinies

SOUNDS:
1. Add background sound when starting game
2. Add shooting sounds for each player/ennemy
3. Add collision sounds
4. Add start/reset button sounds
5. Add Winnin & GameOver sounds

                                      DAY ONE
                                      ********

HTML:

Created most HTML structure based one wireframe.

CSS:

. Styled the grid and used flexbox to move <aside> to the right.
. Created Play Game and Restart buttons. Linked PlayGame button to JS. Play Game button functioning.

JS:

. Created Grid 20*20
, Added player and invaders on grid
. Got stuck with invaders moving pattern, for some reason they would bounce on each side only for two lines.
. Used "!goingRight" with a bang operator instead of "goingLeft", also increased grid to 20*20 as I was getting an error with 10*10.


                                      ********
                                      DAY TWO 
                                      ********

HTML:

. Made some tweaks to the structure to adapt CSS. Added <span> elements, added another container for score-board.
. Added all content such as GAME RULES, SCORE, LIVES.
. Added retro font for the whole page

JS:
. Created shooting functions for both Player (with space bar) and Invaders (randomly shooting in intervals)
. 


CSS:

. Styled the page with background theme Mario World.
. Added Mario's fireballs
. Added Wario Fighters "Spinies" as bullets
. Added brick wall as Mario's shield
. Added box-shadow on both game-container and <aside> container to add some depth to the game

                                      **********
                                      DAY THREE:
                                      **********

HTML:

Added <audio> tags and tested for background sound when Play button clicked.

JS:

. Added "lives" function with changes made in the DOM for player to see.
. Added "Game Over"  and "You Win!" to the DOM for player to see.
. Had a bug when added invaders as a W shape as they were coming off the screen. 
  Fixed with "e % width === 0)"
. When creating Play/Restart buttons I started to have lots of bugs in the game such as: 
  bullets getting stuck in the grid, bullets/bricks collision not happening.
. Included most function for the game in the "Play" function to resolve this, however still had some issues with it.

CSS:

Created Play/Restart button and styled it to 80's arcade games.
Added various styling

                                        *********
                                        DAY FOUR
                                        *********

HTML:

. Added a two more <audio> tags as sounds so that sounds could play each other
. Added incon to the page


JS:

. Removed restart button and instead created a Play/Restart function while 
  changing innerHTML when clicked.
. Debuged balls going off grid
. Debuged balls which were killing all invaders in their path
. Debugged turtles getting stuck in div's randomly by increasing their speed
. Added sounds for background music, balls/bullet thrown, Game Over, Winning, getting hit,
  ennemy being hit, button start being clicked.

CSS:

Create responsive design for screens under XXpx
Added background images
Created personalised logo 
Modified colors of button to match logo colors

PRESENTATION
************ 

BUGS:

. Balls get disabled when shooting Shield too many times
. If ennemies touch the ground before touching Player, the game does not end.

AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT:

. Reduce the number of bullets that can be thrown. Possibly use an interval.
. Add collision styling when bullets/balls hit a target
. Flip axis of Player's image left to right when keys are being pressed 

QUESTIONS:

What code are you proud of/something you think is cool? ->
Happy with the styling overall.

What have you learned? -->
Learned a lot about the logic behind each function and how they are all connected.
The most I learned was when debuging.

What did you find hard / what problem did you solve? -->
The hardest things to figure out (and debug) were PlayerShooting and InvadersShooting functions.
